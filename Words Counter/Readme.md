Considering this as a Flutter developer, it was a nice possibility to try out SwiftUI. As for the software architecture, MVC would also be good enough as controller wouldn't get too big and complex but I still preffer the Controller-ViewModel separation that MVVM enables. Formatting of strings could be done within the ViewModel itself but I kept it as a part of parser for the simplicity sake.
